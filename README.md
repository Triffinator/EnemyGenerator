EnemyGenerator
==============

Psuedo-random enemy generator for Text Based Adventure.

This project is a WIP. It generates an enemy "race" randomly, assigns them stats and modifies these stats to suit combat with a player (see: Triffinator/Character Builder). The stats are also modified to meet different requirements for each "race".

This is designed as a non-deterministic encounter generator for a Text Based Adventure.
